**What is Bingo in Scrabble? How to get more Bingos?**

1. **Bingo** is a term used in Scrabble where a player puts seven tiles on the board in a single turn. Outside North America, Mattel, the game's producer, uses the term bonus to describe such a word. It is called Scrabble in French.
2. In addition to what the word would normally score, a player that does this receives 50 points.
3. Bingos are an important part of achieving high scores in this game.
4. Bingo examples:

The highest scoring 7-letter bingo is "MUZJIKS".

The highest scoring 8-letter bingo is "QUIZZIFY"

The highest scoring 8-letter bingo is "QUIZZIFY"

The highest scoring 8-letter bingo in Naspa Word List and the highest scoring 8-letter bingo without a blank is "QUINZHEE"

The lowest possible score for bingo is 56

The highest scoring 15-letter bingo "[OXYPHENBUTAZONE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyphenbutazone)"

Using the TWL(Naspa Word List) lexicon, the most probable bingos are ANEROID, AILERON/ALIENOR, ATONIES, ELATION/TOENAIL, and ERASION.

**How to get more Bingo?**

1. Bingos are when a player makes a word that uses all their letters, usually a seven-letter word using no letters currently on the board, or an eight-letter word using one letter on the board. If the player holds the letters AEGINRT and the word CAR is on the board, the following boards will show examples of the 7-letter and 8-letter bingo that can be played:

   Bingos are important because making one yield a 50-point bonus on top of other scores. Therefore, Bingos have the potential to drastically change the dynamics of a game. In a typical Scrabble game, the player who makes the most bingos will be the victor the vast majority of the time. A single player making 2 or 3 bingos is very common, and it is not unheard of for a player to make 5 or even 6 bingos in a strong game. In the Scrabble Tournament, it is rare for a player not to make a single bingo throughout the game, even in games where they lose a lot.

   Bingos are important because making one yield a 50-point bonus on top of other scores. Therefore, Bingos have the potential to drastically change the dynamics of a game. In a typical Scrabble game, the player who makes the most bingos will be the victor the vast majority of the time. A single player making 2 or 3 bingos is very common, and it is not unheard of for a player to make 5 or even 6 bingos in a strong game. In the Scrabble Tournament, it is rare for a player not to make a single bingo throughout the game, even in games where they lose a lot.

   Despite this Bingos are very hard to pull off. Let’s imagine a scenario, it is the start of the game and you are going first. The chance that you will draw 7 random letters that make up a valid English word is about 10%. And many of these valid words are obscure and unknown to the average Scrabble player. For example, if IJLNOQU were drawn, even players with strong word knowledge would have a hard time recognizing JONQUIL, a yellow flower.To play bingo, you must have the letters, know the word, and successfully identify the word in your jumbled rack within the time constraint, hardly an easy task.

   Time constraint is a real issue for the players of the tournament. Each player has a total of 25 minutes to play in the game. Since the average game is 12-14 rounds, this means that each player uses 1:30 to 2:00 per round, holding back some time in case they need it for late-game decisions, where they can spend 2:00 to 4:00 for a decision. This is the part of the game where there is a lot more clarity about what letters remain and how many points are needed to either catch up or get the game out of reach.

   The chances of a player finding a bingo rely heavily on recognition of probability and letter distributions. Letters such as E, A, S, T, R, N, I, or the blank tile are considered "bingo prone" because they appear in a high percentage of valid English words, whereas letters such as V, U, Z, X, W, K are bad bingos.Since some letters are more represented in the letter bag than others, you can learn words that have a higher chance of being drawn. Bingo prone letter can drastically improve your chances of drawing a bingo on the following turn. Now let's look at another example. Say your leave consists of the letters AEINRT, which spell the word RETINA. You can make BARINET if you draw a B. C makes CERTAIN, D makes TRAINED, E makes TRAINEE, F makes FAINTER, G produces TEARING, etc. There are only a handful of letters that do not combine with AEINRT to make a valid 7 letter word. Throughout the game, players track which letters have been played so that they can deduce the letters that are currently left in the bag and calculate the chance that they will draw a bingo with their leave. It's done on the official score sheet. The AEINRT letters are referred to as 'stems,' and there are hundreds of stems commonly memorized by tournament players. List of common stem words:

   - diastem. stemmas. stemmed. stemmer.
   - blastema. bluestem. diastema. diastems.
   - blastemal. blastemas. bluestems. distemper.
   - abstemious. blastemata. diastemata. distempers.
   - blastematic. distempered. intersystem.
   - abstemiously. distemperate. distempering.
   - biosystematic. epistemically. nonsystematic.
   - abstemiousness. biosystematics. biosystematist.

   Although AEINRT is a good leave, it would be very uncommon to have this leave in a game. To guarantee a leave of AEINRT, you would need to only play the letter A. It is very difficult to score a lot by placing only 1 letter on the board. On the other hand, if you played a longer word for more points, like maybe RETINA itself, you would only be leaving A, and you would have a much lower chance of playing bingo on your next turn. There is a huge tradeoff between scoring high on your play and leaving as many bingo prone letters as possible. In most situations, the best play would be to leave a few bingo prone letters, like ERT or AERT, which give you more flexibility in the play you make now while improving your bingo chances in the future.

   Scrabble games are timed and precise calculations often take too long to execute in practice. Being able to quickly recognize how bingo prone a leave is, and to determine how many points you would be willing to sacrifice in the current play to obtain it, can only be achieved through trial and error throughout thousands of practice games.

   **How to use Hooks in Scrabble to win a game?**

   Players refer to the letters played at the front or back of a word as a hook. A well-placed hook can make for surprising changes in the meaning or sound of the original word. In laymen terms, The hooking refers to a kind of “parasite” attaching to the words that are already on the board. You add a letter to a word that already exists. The easiest way to do this is, of course, to form a plural word out of a singular one. For eg, the term HOOK can be applied to HOOKS. The letter S is the "hook" and the word HOOKS is hooked, so it's the word "hook." But the trick with Hook is not only to spread a word, but also to create a new word.

   Example of **front hook** words:

   NAKED -- SNAKED

   RATIFY -- GRATIFY

   EARN -- YEARN

   WADDLE -- SWADDLE

   INCH -- FINCH

   FAR -- FARD

   OKAY -- TOKAY

   LUNG -- LUNGI

   NANA -- JNANA

   HILL -- THILL

   ![](/uploads/hookspng.jpg)

   **2-3 letter hook words:**

   - AD -- ADZ
   - AG -- ZAG
   - AS -- ZAS
   - AX -- ZAX
   - BE -- BEZ
   - BI -- BIZ
   - EA -- ZEA
   - ED -- ZED
   - EE -- ZEE
   - EL -- ZEL
   - EX -- ZEX
   - FE -- FEZ
   - HO -- ZHO
   - IN -- ZIN
   - IT -- ZIT
   - MI -- MIZ
   - MO -- MOZ
   - OO -- ZOO
   - OS -- ZOS

   Consider the Outplaying - It’s more than eight letters. We netted all those lovely points by slipping OUT at the start and -ING at the end of the word PLAY.

   Prefix and Suffix examples - OUT : Outplay, outrun, look out, run out. OVER : overblow, overtake, turnover, walkover, UP : makeup, upbraid, DOWN : downbeat, downpour, rundown, sundown.

   Wrap around letter examples: Turn Deal into Ideals. Me can become Amen or Demean.

   **What are Vowel dumps?**

   There are words with several vowels in them, at least two or three in common. When you play Scrabble, the last thing you want is to be left with a bunch of letters that you can't play and you can't think of any words that you can do with it. The best way to use vowel dumps correctly is to learn as many vowel dumps as possible:

   **2 Letter Words**

   Aa- 2 points

   Ae- 2 points

   Ai- 2 points

   oe-2 points

   **3 letter words**

   Eau - 4 points
