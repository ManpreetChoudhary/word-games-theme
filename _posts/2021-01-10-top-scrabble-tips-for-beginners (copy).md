6\.Word extenders

Prefixes and suffixes such as UN-, RE-, –ER and –ED also serve as great word extenders especially when used to extend a word over a double or triple word square!

7\. Try to overlap words instead of intersecting them

In the image below, the words Fig and Holed both are overlapping the word Fazed by two letters.In this case, you get points in three words instead of one, so try and overlap words on the board by at least two or three letters. This Scrabble strategy can help you gain points really fast.

For example, if you add the suffix "ER" to "TRAIN," you can make the word "TRAINER."Or if your opponent played the word "MATCH," you can add the prefix "MIS" to make "MISMATCH" .

13\.Using Q

**How to score a Scrabble play**

Scrabble is scored by adding the numbers on each letter tile together within the word that is formed on a player's turn, which includes letters that were played from the player's rack and letters already on the board.This may sound simple, but once you start playing this game , scoring Scrabble can get a little tricky. So we have documented some quick tips for beginners on how they can score themselves as well as their opponents.

- Special squares (double letter score, triple letter score, and so forth) only count the first time a letter is played on them.
- The light blue double letter square doubles the point value for the tile played on it, and the blue triple letter square triples the value for the tile. If a blank tile is played on either of these special squares, it still contributes nothing toward the total word score because a blank tile has a score of zero.
- The pink double word squares double the entire word value and the red triple word scores triple the entire word value. This remains true even if a blank tile covers the double word score or triple word score square. The pink square in the middle of the board used to start the game is a double word score.
- Double letter and triple letter squares are counted first to obtain the initial word score, and then any double word score or triple word score squares are counted.
- A player using all seven letters in their rack gains a bonus 50 points to their score after all other special squares are counted. The 50 bonus points do not count toward double and triple word scores.
- If two or more words are formed on a single turn, each word is scored individually. This means any special scoring squares are counted for both words.
- At the end of the game, all tiles in a player's rack are subtracted from their score and the highest score wins. If two players tie, the person with the fewest points subtracted from their score wins.

In order to win this game, each one of you would want to score as much as possible. Each player pulls from a pool of 100 random letter tiles, creating words, and aligning them on a grid-like game board. When one player has used all of their tiles and there are no more tiles left to draw, the game ends. Word scores and a player's total points ultimately determine the winner.

Now interestingly, while the rules surrounding the end of a Scrabble game seem to be universally accepted, the proper method of scoring—which determines the winner of the game—depends on which set of rules you follow. The game manufacturer's scoring rules (Hasbro) differ from those of the North American Scrabble Players Association, the host of the annual National Scrabble Championship and the world's leading organization of Scrabble enthusiasts.

According to the North American Scrabble Players Association tournament and club play, the player who ends the game earns double the points on all of the tiles remaining on all of his or her opponents' racks. The other players subtract nothing from their totals!
