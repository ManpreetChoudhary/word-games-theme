&lt;p&gt;Words with Friends is a multiplayer word game designed by Newtoy. Players turn to construct crossword-puzzle-style words in a manner similar to the classic Scrabble board game. The rules of both games are identical, but Words with Friends is not synonymous with the Scrabble brand. Up to 40 games can be played simultaneously using push notifications to alert players when they turn. Players can look up friends either by username or Facebook, or be randomly assigned to an opponent by “Smart Match” Players can also find potential opponents by using the Community Match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Released in July 2009, Words with Friends is available for cross-platform play on Android, Windows Phone, and iOS operating systems. The game can also be found on Facebook, Kindle Fire, and Nook Tablet. In addition, there is a chat feature built into the game that allows the opponent to exchange messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2010 and 2011, Words with Friends was one of the top-ranking games in the iOS app store. A sequel to the game, Words with Friends 2, was released in September 2017. The rules of the game are generally the same as those of the two-player Scrabble, with a few differences, such as the arrangement of the premium squares and the distribution and point values of some of the letters. Players will receive seven randomly selected letter tiles, which will be replenished until all 104 tiles have been used.Players take turns creating words on the board or, instead of playing a word, they can may opt to swap tiles with a pool of currently unused tiles or move their turn. Players can form words on the board either vertically or horizontally. The goal of the player is to score as many points as possible.In 2012, Zynga, in collaboration with Hasbro, launched several iterations of the “Hasbro Gaming” versions of Words with Friends. In October 2019, it was revealed that the hack of Zynga’s social game creator had compromised the data of 218 million Words with Friends profiles. The information you access include player names, email addresses, login IDs, phone numbers, and Zynga account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve been playing Scrabble for years. Family brought it out to battle an often dull rainy day, or friends used it to give game night a little of an analytical edge. Then came Zynga’s Words with Friends, an incredibly common app that lets you play in—say—”Scrabble-like” let’s games with your buddies or even strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no wonder that a lot of people love to play word games. They’re the best way to mix fun and vocabulary. When it comes to the debate of what kind of games are at the forefront when it comes to educational advantages, there’s no doubt that word games are the champions.We just need outlets to help us face the day, and that might be word games for you if you plan to give them a try and enjoy them from time to time. Here’s how this game will be helpful to your mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress relief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word games have a role to play in calming anxiety and alleviating stress. You’ve probably heard how you lose yourself in the game and forget about all your issues. They are also known to produce dopamine, which is the chemical that helps us experience joy, optimism and accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvisation of vocabulary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is immense satisfaction in being able to use large words and also having the ability to understand complex concepts. Word games are selling it. After a while of playing, you’ll find that you’ve mastered new vocabulary that you wouldn’t have known otherwise. Not only does learning new words and improving your vocabulary make you feel amazing, but it’s also a factor in your personal growth and can help you progress your career, particularly if you’re a writer. Not to mention, it could make you look smart. There are many ways you can broaden your vocabulary. One of these is knowing anagrams. An anagram means that there are two separate words with the same characters. They can have the same meaning, opposite meanings, or relevant meanings. You may use an online unscrambler for anagrams that can go a long way toward preparing your mind to function better and learn new anagrams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helps is socializing better with others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word games are a fun way to get to know people. You can gather new or old friends and play together in teams that will make you all bond. Socialization provides a lot of mental health advantages. According to study, it will boost the attitude. There are various mental and physical health benefits to socializing, such as stress relief and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concentration booster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentration is an important skill that we need in everyday life, from doing simple things to solving big problems. You’ll need to focus to solve word games, particularly puzzle games. The more difficult the word is, the more concentrated you have to be. After a while of playing regularly, you’ll notice that you’re going to solve them faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving brain functions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing word games can improve various brain functions, such as problem-solving, memory, cognition, and creativity. They can all make life easier and help you move forward in your career and on a more personal level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think that your Words With Friends addiction helps your brain, you might be wrong. While these kinds of games (Words with Friends, Scrabble, and Sudoko) help keep our brains sharp, according to our experts, they will not help to reduce your risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia on their own.Dr. Marie Pasinski, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, a faculty member at Harvard Medical School, and author of a book, Beautiful Brain, Beautiful You, says brain games are good, but once you’ve mastered that game or skill, you don’t do any favors to your brain. Let’s look at her tips to improve brain health:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning something new&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our brains have this incredible ability to make new neurons and new connections throughout our lives,” says Pasinski. The bottom line: you’re never too old to learn new skills. Pasinski says that one of her patients, a woman in the mid-40s, recently started singing and memorizing lyrics, and now her brain is sharper than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting more sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pasinski says that. “Sleep promotes neuroplasticity, the growth of new neurons. New neurons grow in the hippocampus, the brain’s memory center, and sleep deprivation reduces the production of new neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving one’s diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Diet is incredibly important and a Mediterranean-style diet is the best diet for the brain. It has been associated with improved cognitive function and lower rates of dementia,” says Pasinski. “Probably one of the reasons that is good for the brain is that it is rich in omega-3s, which are literally the building blocks of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Popular word games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossword puzzles are the most famous word game ever. They’re old-fashioned but timelessly entertaining. They have the most obvious benefit of improving your vocabulary, especially for young students and people learning English as a new language. They can also release stress by shutting down the voices in our brains and allowing us to enjoy the game. Scrabble has similar health benefits as it releases stress, engages your mind, and teaches you new vocabulary. They help you develop your intellectual abilities, as you learn new words about different topics. It’s a game that encourages a group game that allows you to get to know new people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call your friends and get together to have a lovely evening full of challenging, brain-teasing and mind-squeezing. Getting better at these games will boost your self-confidence and vigor, as well as enrich personal development skills. Most importantly, it’s the perfect way to relax and be stress-free.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Thandra</name></author><category term="wordswithletters" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/uploads/output-3.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/uploads/output-3.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">What are some of the benefits of playing Word with Friends</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/sample-3" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What are some of the benefits of playing Word with Friends" /><published>2021-01-18T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-01-18T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/sample-3</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/sample-3">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/useful-2.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Players will receive seven randomly selected letter tiles, which will be replenished until all 104 tiles have been used.Players take turns creating words on the board or, instead of playing a word, they can may opt to swap tiles with a pool of currently unused tiles or move their turn. Players can form words on the board either vertically or horizontally. The goal of the player is to score as many points as possible.In 2012, Zynga, in collaboration with Hasbro, launched several iterations of the “Hasbro Gaming” versions of Words with Friends. In October 2019, it was revealed that the hack of Zynga’s social game creator had compromised the data of 218 million Words with Friends profiles. The information you access include player names, email addresses, login IDs, phone numbers, and Zynga account.&lt;/p&gt;

Then came Zynga’s Words with Friends, an incredibly common app that lets you play in—say—”Scrabble-like” let’s games with your buddies or even strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no wonder that a lot of people love to play word games. They’re the best way to mix fun and vocabulary. When it comes to the debate of what kind of games are at the forefront when it comes to educational advantages, there’s no doubt that word games are the champions.We just need outlets to help us face the day, and that might be word games for you if you plan to give them a try and enjoy them from time to time. Here’s how this game will be helpful to your mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress relief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word games have a role to play in calming anxiety and alleviating stress. You’ve probably heard how you lose yourself in the game and forget about all your issues. They are also known to produce dopamine, which is the chemical that helps us experience joy, optimism and accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvisation of vocabulary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is immense satisfaction in being able to use large words and also having the ability to understand complex concepts. Word games are selling it. After a while of playing, you’ll find that you’ve mastered new vocabulary that you wouldn’t have known otherwise.

Not to mention, it could make you look smart. There are many ways you can broaden your vocabulary. One of these is knowing anagrams. An anagram means that there are two separate words with the same characters. They can have the same meaning, opposite meanings, or relevant meanings. You may use an online unscrambler for anagrams that can go a long way toward preparing your mind to function better and learn new anagrams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helps is socializing better with others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentration is an important skill that we need in everyday life, from doing simple things to solving big problems. You’ll need to focus to solve word games, particularly puzzle games. The more difficult the word is, the more concentrated you have to be. After a while of playing regularly, you’ll notice that you’re going to solve them faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving brain functions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing word games can improve various brain functions, such as problem-solving, memory, cognition, and creativity. They can all make life easier and help you move forward in your career and on a more personal level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think that your Words With Friends addiction helps your brain, you might be wrong. While these kinds of games (Words with Friends, Scrabble, and Sudoko) help keep our brains sharp, according to our experts, they will not help to reduce your risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia on their own.Dr. Marie Pasinski, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, a faculty member at Harvard Medical School, and author of a book, Beautiful Brain, Beautiful You, says brain games are good, but once you’ve mastered that game or skill, you don’t do any favors to your brain. Let’s look at her tips to improve brain health:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning something new&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our brains have this incredible ability to make new neurons and new connections throughout our lives,” says Pasinski. The bottom line: you’re never too old to learn new skills. Pasinski says that one of her patients, a woman in the mid-40s, recently started singing and memorizing lyrics, and now her brain is sharper than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting more sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pasinski says that. “Sleep promotes neuroplasticity, the growth of new neurons. New neurons grow in the hippocampus, the brain’s memory center, and sleep deprivation reduces the production of new neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving one’s diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Diet is incredibly important and a Mediterranean-style diet is the best diet for the brain. It has been associated with improved cognitive function and lower rates of dementia,” says Pasinski. “Probably one of the reasons that is good for the brain is that it is rich in omega-3s, which are literally the building blocks of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Popular word games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossword puzzles are the most famous word game ever. They’re old-fashioned but timelessly entertaining. They have the most obvious benefit of improving your vocabulary, especially for young students and people learning English as a new language. They can also release stress by shutting down the voices in our brains and allowing us to enjoy the game. Scrabble has similar health benefits as it releases stress, engages your mind, and teaches you new vocabulary. They help you develop your intellectual abilities, as you learn new words about different topics. It’s a game that encourages a group game that allows you to get to know new people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call your friends and get together to have a lovely evening full of challenging, brain-teasing and mind-squeezing. Getting better at these games will boost your self-confidence and vigor, as well as enrich personal development skills. Most importantly, it’s the perfect way to relax and be stress-free.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>alka</name></author><category term="wordswithletters" /><summary type="html">Words with Friends is a multiplayer word game designed by Newtoy.

This game was named Scrabble. Even today this game continues to delight most game lovers. This game contains aspects of language and strategy and acing the game is not easy for new players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seriously doubt if there is any perfect strategy to play this game.When you watch scrabble as a competitive sport you will begin to notice how every player changes their move on spot. They rapidly change their gears from being highly offensive to highly defensive depending on the game they are playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have recently started to play this game and want some great strategies, we have compiled a &lt;strong&gt;list of tips and tricks&lt;/strong&gt; that could help you next time when you play this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Read the instruction manual carefully&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is expected to read the instruction manual before you start playing any game, you will be most surprised to learn that many players do not read them.Not reading the instruction manual of this game is an error most newbies make as these manuals contains tips and tricks that could aide you in this game.One of the main tips is to learn as many valid two and three letter words that could be beneficial in this game. There are plenty of websites online that could assist you in this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.Rack Balance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shuffle the tiles on your rack frequently. You’ll be amazed to see that just by shuffling on an apparently poor looking rack even a bingo may appear as if by magic!Maintaining a ratio of 3:4 of vowels to consonants will provide you with more options to make words regardless of the plays on the board. Once your rack is balanced, try playing this same combination each time to maintain your deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.Challenging the defence player&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must be well aware of the challenging your opponent strategy if you have played poker or any card games. Since scrabble is a word game there could be plentiful opportunity when your opponent might be bluffing you regarding a certain word. When unsure about the word, definitely challenge your opponent. On a brighter note, if the opponent is not bluffing you will end up learning new words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.Offence vs Defence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since scrabble is a word game, you have no way to know what words your defence player has and what edge does it give them. The best you can do is to play this game smartly and limit the opponents chances to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.Use triple word squares wisely&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 8 triple letter squares spread on the scrabble board. These squares are generally indicated in orange and labeled ‘TW’, short for Triple Word. Making words with good point letters like K, P, F or M and higher point letters such as J, X, Q or Z can help you accelerate the points on your scorecard.When in game mode, be extra careful around these squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.Word extenders&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prefixes and suffixes such as UN-, RE-, –ER and –ED also serve as great word extenders especially when used to extend a word over a double or triple word square!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7. Try to overlap words instead of intersecting them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the image below, the words Fig and Holed both are overlapping the word Fazed by two letters.In this case, you get points in three words instead of one, so try and overlap words on the board by at least two or three letters. This Scrabble strategy can help you gain points really fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.Using app based dictionaries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though dictionaries are not allowed in this game, you could still improve your scrabble strategies by learning new words from several app based dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9.Place letters around bonus tiles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to having an edge in this game,bonus tiles are the key way to increase the number of points you can win.In this game you need to utilize the double/ triple letter and double/triple word spaces in order to play well. Use these spots as it will cut your opponents from scoring more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10.Magic letters A,E,I,L,N,R,S,T&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the most commonly used letters in the English alphabet. Whenever you are having a tough time coming up with words, these words could help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11. Memorizing some two or three letter words&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing some words by heart can definitely assist you in a slippery situation to defeat your opponent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12.Prefix and Suffixes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common examples for suffixes include S, -ED, -ER, -ING, -LY, -ENT, -IEST, -FUL, -ITY, -NESS, -CY, -AL, -TION, -ITE in addition to prefixes NON-, EX-, TRI-, PRE-, and MIS-. For example, if you add the suffix “ER” to “TRAIN,” you can make the word “TRAINER.”Or if your opponent played the word “MATCH,” you can add the prefix “MIS” to make “MISMATCH” .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13.Using Q&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably one of the toughest letter to use as not many words use this letter. Using this letter at the earliest possible opportunity means it gives you a definite edge over your opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14.Save letter J,X or Z for triple points&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the letter Q, another way to get big points on the board is with the letters J, X, and/or Z. Using them in the right spaces means you can rack up double or possibly even triple digit points in a single round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15.Using parallel wisely&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play them parallel to any word on the board. Get points for every new word you create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16.Trading your letters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exchange letters if you’re truly desperate as it forces you to give up your turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17.Think long, think Bingo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan ahead to play long words. Playing all your tiles is known as “bingo” and earns you bonus points. The most common letters that players save to create a bingo word are “A,” “E,” “I,” “N,” “R,” and “S.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18.Consonant overload&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a lot of these like “myrrh,” “rhythm,” and “tsktsk,” for example, the best strategy for you would be to memorize some of the words from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/scrabble-words-with-no-vowels-412400&quot;&gt;Scrabble words&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to score a Scrabble play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrabble is scored by adding the numbers on each letter tile together within the word that is formed on a player’s turn, which includes letters that were played from the player’s rack and letters already on the board.This may sound simple, but once you start playing this game , scoring Scrabble can get a little tricky. So we have documented some quick tips for beginners on how they can score themselves as well as their opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Special squares (double letter score, triple letter score, and so forth) only count the first time a letter is played on them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The light blue double letter square doubles the point value for the tile played on it, and the blue triple letter square triples the value for the tile. If a blank tile is played on either of these special squares, it still contributes nothing toward the total word score because a blank tile has a score of zero.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The pink double word squares double the entire word value and the red triple word scores triple the entire word value. This remains true even if a blank tile covers the double word score or triple word score square. The pink square in the middle of the board used to start the game is a double word score.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Double letter and triple letter squares are counted first to obtain the initial word score, and then any double word score or triple word score squares are counted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A player using all seven letters in their rack gains a bonus 50 points to their score after all other special squares are counted. The 50 bonus points do not count toward double and triple word scores.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If two or more words are formed on a single turn, each word is scored individually. This means any special scoring squares are counted for both words.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the end of the game, all tiles in a player’s rack are subtracted from their score and the highest score wins. If two players tie, the person with the fewest points subtracted from their score wins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is the game over?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Scrabble is the most popular word game ever developed in 1933 in order to uplift your mood following the Great Depression. The official rules are provided to the players on the company’s website as well as with the game packaging itself.Despite the published rules there seems to be some minor disagreement over how to end this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to win this game, each one of you would want to score as much as possible. Each player pulls from a pool of 100 random letter tiles, creating words, and aligning them on a grid-like game board. When one player has used all of their tiles and there are no more tiles left to draw, the game ends. Word scores and a player’s total points ultimately determine the winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now interestingly, while the rules surrounding the end of a Scrabble game seem to be universally accepted, the proper method of scoring—which determines the winner of the game—depends on which set of rules you follow. The game manufacturer’s scoring rules (Hasbro) differ from those of the North American Scrabble Players Association, the host of the annual National Scrabble Championship and the world’s leading organization of Scrabble enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the North American Scrabble Players Association tournament and club play, the player who ends the game earns double the points on all of the tiles remaining on all of his or her opponents’ racks. The other players subtract nothing from their totals!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing scrabble is unique when it is compared to other board games. Regardless of the fact that you win or lose, this game helps in promoting a great sense of satisfaction and confidence therefore boosting the well being of a person.Therefore,accept your losses and your wins graciously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to think strategically about scrabble?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We don’t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.” George Bernard Shaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is scrabble?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a common household game invented in 1938 by an American architect called Alfred Mosher Butts. It’s an indoor board game that facilitates both competitive and cooperative play. It can be played by two or four teams. Board games guarantee to bond. Playing Scrabble bonds you as a family, laughing, building trust and sportsmanship, and love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is scrabble a family game and how can it help your child?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides being a lot of fun, playing Scrabble has many benefits, particularly for children. Scrabble is a game for youth, parents, and grandparents alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game can help in memory training and enhancing cognitive skills. This game also enhances problem-solving, as the relevant parts of the brain are being used extensively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By playing the game regularly, kids can improve their vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also observe quick reaction as the time is taken to perform tasks are lesser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing a board game like Scrabble can help children develop reasoning skills and creative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This board game required movement skills and dexterity to work on the tiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it is a fine form of occupational therapy for children with special needs and those recovering from accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How playing Scrabble can improve your business skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing scrabble will motivate you to become a successful businessman. This is more than just a word game as this can teach you analytical thinking, concentration, and certain creativity. There are scrabble tactics that you can use in real life and useful skills that you can hone by playing daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try different perspectives: Sometimes while playing this game you may end up with a blank mind that stares endlessly at the word and doesn’t come up with any clue. This is when you need to slightly shuffle around the words in order to make sense. You can also apply this simple strategy in your life circumstances, whenever you feel burdened with problems you are unable to solve try looking at them from different angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy is important in this game: Similarly, in business, you need to be well aware of who your competitors are and what their next move will be and impact your business. When you play, you try to maximize your points, and you should always try to maximize your profits while negotiating, buying or selling in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to use your best assets. Just like you shouldn’t be saving your highest point letters for later, you also shouldn’t wait out any opportunities or waste your current competencies only to gain others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite frequently, when playing scrabble, people concentrate on their own tiles without noticing the board. That’s how they miss amazing opportunities. Business is similar and you need to set bigger goals and consider all possible ways of reaching them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be defensive. Similarly in business, consider every offer carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both scrabble and company, it is important to know the correct words and to be able to spell them correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first term in Scrabble sets the pace for the entire game. Similarly, the first impression is in the business world, especially if you work in sales or marketing is equally important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose and in every game, there is an opportunity to learn something new. So you can learn from your business competitors and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tricks to win every Scrabble game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrabble combines the best aspects of language, strategy, and board games, and winning this game doesn’t come with great ease. We have compiled a few easy tips and tricks for you to assist you in winning the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn 2 and 3 letter words. These 2 and 3 letter words can boost your winning streak and win you more points.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using the letter’s’ to construct two words at once. By adding an ‘s’ to the ending of a word you can pluralize it. However, use your ‘s’ word wisely.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place tiles that create a common ending or beginning at the appropriate side of your board game. Many words end in “-er,” “-ed,” or “-ing,” so putting those on the left-right side of your rack will help you in quickly deciding when to use them. The same applies to word-beginnings, like “un-,” “in-,” or “re-.” Put them on the opposite side.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look for ‘hooks’ as these are single letters you can add to existing words to make completely new ones. For example “Lush” turns into “blush.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save the combination of letters AEILNRST. You can create Starline.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The letter “q,” the best score in scrabble tile along with the letter “z.”Memorize some words like qabala, qabalah, qadi, qat, qaid, qi, qoph, faqir, mbaqanga, qanat, tranq, qindar, qintar, qwerty, sheqel, qindarka, and sheqalm.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! Your search for “How to turn a mobile website into an android app” has landed you in the perfect place. This blog will be covering some of the technical ways to get this job done and hence is recommended for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to advancements in the technology sector, the ever-existing war between websites and apps is somewhere subsiding. While both websites and mobile apps have established their dominance in the market, business enterprises want to achieve greater reaches by establishing themselves over both websites and apps. As a matter of fact, almost every business enterprise claimed to witness greater reachability after establishing themselves on both web and app as opposed to just one, Although a decade earlier from now, developers would have had to write separate codes for both websites and apps, in the 21st century it is now possible to convert a website into an app without writing any heavy codes at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers might want to convert their websites to mobile apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To target more audience and to get a better reach.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apps can outperform their corresponding websites in revenue generation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To have the power to send push notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To enhance the mobile user experience and to meet modern user expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To build more loyalty and engagement by establishing itself on an app market such as Google PlayStore or Apple AppStore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that converting a website to an app does not affect the website at all. The website can still behave the same way and is not destroyed or changed. Now that you know how beneficial this practice can be, let’s look at some of the ways you can convert an existing website into a mobile app. So let’s get started without further ado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;making-your-website-mobile-friendly&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Making your website mobile-friendly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and foremost step in converting a website to an app is to make it mobile-friendly. You must remember that your website turned app will later be used on smaller screen devices such as mobiles or tablets and you need to optimize it accordingly. Therefore, to make your website mobile-friendly, follow these points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Width and height constraints:&lt;/strong&gt; You need to set the width and height constraints such that no content is cut off from the display of mobile/tablet devices. It should fit the device’s screen aptly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ever-present navigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Since the mobile app has a navigation system that is mostly physical and ever-present, you need to incorporate the same in your website. Not only will it make it more user-friendly but will also provide ease of accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No island pages:&lt;/strong&gt; Island pages are such pages from which users cannot return. Therefore, the users get stuck on that page and if they want to get back to the home page, they would have to go through the trouble of restarting your app all again, which certainly is not a good practice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use “_&lt;em&gt;blank&lt;/em&gt;” target for all external domains&lt;/strong&gt;: If you don’t use “_&lt;em&gt;blank&lt;/em&gt;” targets for external domains, that means if a link redirects the user to some other website, it will open on top of your website if the user clicks on it. For a website, this may be perfectly normal. But for an app, this means that the third party app which was intended to open will open in your app making your app buggy and crashy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;converting-a-mobile-website-to-an-android-app-using-android-studio&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Converting a mobile website to an Android app using Android Studio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this blog is supposed to be for developers with some sort of technical knowledge, we will therefore go with Android Studio to get our job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About:&lt;/strong&gt; Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development, based on IntelliJ IDEA. It is the official software used for building native Android apps. The developer can either choose to code in Java or in Kotlin and make beautiful native Android apps. To support application development within the Android operating system, Android Studio uses a Gradle-based build system, emulator, code templates, and Github integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download and install Android Studio on your system if not already installed. Android Studio is heavy software requiring some minimum specs. You can look at the specs by scrolling to the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/studio&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the Android Studio opens and is completely set up, click on &lt;strong&gt;File&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;New&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;New Project…&lt;/strong&gt; and select Empty Activity as the activity type.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;app&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;manifests&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;AndroidMainfest.xml&lt;/strong&gt; and add the following line before the opening of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;application&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.INTERNET&quot;&gt;&lt;/uses-permission&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open &lt;strong&gt;activity_main.xml&lt;/strong&gt; and erase any existing code and paste the following snippet of code:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”utf-8”?&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;RelativeLayout xmlns:android=”http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;xmlns:app=”http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;xmlns:tools=”http://schemas.android.com/tools”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;android:layout_width=”match_parent”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;android:layout_height=”match_parent”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tools:context=”.MainActivity”&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;WebView&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;android:id=”@+id/webview”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;android:layout_width=”match_parent”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;android:layout_height=”match_parent” /&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;/RelativeLayout&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open &lt;strong&gt;styles.xml&lt;/strong&gt; and change the existing style tag to:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;_&lt;style name=&quot;AppTheme&quot; parent=&quot;Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar&quot;&gt;_&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, here we changed &lt;strong&gt;DarkActionBar&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;NoActionBar&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;MainActivity.java&lt;/strong&gt; and replace the existing code with:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;package yourPackageName;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;import android.graphics.Bitmap;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;import android.os.Bundle;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;import android.webkit.WebSettings;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;import android.webkit.WebView;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;import android.webkit.WebViewClient;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;private WebView mywebView;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;@Override&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;mywebView=(WebView) findViewById(R.id.webview);&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;mywebView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient());&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;mywebView.loadUrl(“YourWebsiteURL”);&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WebSettings webSettings=mywebView.getSettings();&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;webSettings.setJavaScriptEnabled(true);&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;}&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;public class mywebClient extends WebViewClient{&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;@Override&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;public void onPageStarted(WebView view, String url, Bitmap favicon){&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;super.onPageStarted(view,url,favicon);&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;}&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;@Override&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view,String url){&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;view.loadUrl(url);&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;return true;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;}&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;}&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;@Override&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;public void onBackPressed(){&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;if(mywebView.canGoBack()) {&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;mywebView.goBack();&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;}&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;else{&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;super.onBackPressed();&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;}&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;}&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;}&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be sure to replace &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;yourPackageName&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the above code with yours. Also, replace &lt;strong&gt;YourWebsiteURL&lt;/strong&gt; with the website that you want to convert in &lt;em&gt;mywebView.loadUrl(“YourWebsiteURL”);&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your app is now all set up. You just need to change the icon of your app.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To change the icon of your app, go to &lt;strong&gt;res&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;drawable&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;em&gt;right-click&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;New&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Image Asset&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/image2-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make the &lt;strong&gt;Asset Type&lt;/strong&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;Image&lt;/strong&gt; and change the &lt;strong&gt;Path&lt;/strong&gt; to the path of your icon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adjust the icon and click &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your app is now all ready. You just need to generate the APK.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To generate the APK file of your Android Studio project, go to &lt;strong&gt;Build&lt;/strong&gt; and select &lt;strong&gt;Generate Signed Bundle / APK…&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/image5-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the window that appears, enter all the details and choose a password.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/image4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt; and select release as the &lt;strong&gt;Build Variants&lt;/strong&gt; and check both the checkboxes in &lt;strong&gt;Signature Versions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/image3-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At last, click on &lt;strong&gt;Finish&lt;/strong&gt; and your app will be ready in few minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have now successfully converted your website to an Android app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having converted, or more aptly, generated a brand new Android app from your existing mobile website, you can publish it across various app markets. The best choice would be of course to go with the Google PlayStore as it is the official app market for Android devices and comes pre-installed. However, publishing an app to the Google PlayStore requires a Google Developer account which is paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if you would like to try with the free ones then Amazon’s App Store makes another great choice. Hope you achieve your required results and try this way out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Keshav</name></author><category term="General" /><category term="Website to app" /><category term="Website to Android" /><category term="App converter" /><summary type="html">Easily turn a Mobile Website into an Android App</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/uploads/output-25.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/uploads/output-25.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
